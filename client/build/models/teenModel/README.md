# Teen Character 3D Models

This directory should contain your GLB (GLTF Binary) model file for the teenage character that appears in the "About Me" section.

## Required Files

Please add your GLB file with this exact name:

1. `character.glb` - Main character model

## File Requirements

- **Format**: GLB (GLTF Binary) format
- **Size**: Recommended to keep under 10MB for optimal loading
- **Animations**: Any embedded animations will be automatically played
- **Textures**: Should be embedded in the GLB file

## Features

- **Animations**: If your model contains animations (like waving, idle poses), they will be automatically detected and played
- **Responsive**: The character will display properly on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Fallback**: If no model is found, a geometric fallback character will be displayed

## Tips for Optimal Results

- Ensure your model is centered at origin (0, 0, 0) in your 3D software
- Use realistic proportions for a teenage character
- Include a waving animation if possible for the greeting effect
- Test your model in a GLB viewer before adding it here

## Fallback

If no model is found or there are loading errors, a geometric fallback character will be displayed instead.
