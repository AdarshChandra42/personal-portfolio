# Astronaut 3D Model

This directory should contain your GLB (GLTF Binary) model file for the astronaut character that appears in the Hero section.

## Required Files

Please add your GLB file with this exact name:

1. `astronaut.glb` - Main astronaut model

## File Requirements

- **Format**: GLB (GLTF Binary) format
- **Size**: Recommended to keep under 15MB for optimal loading
- **Animations**: Any embedded animations will be automatically played
- **Textures**: Should be embedded in the GLB file

## Features

- **Rotation**: The astronaut will automatically rotate slowly
- **Floating Animation**: The model will have a gentle floating motion
- **Responsive**: The model will display properly on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Fallback**: If no model is found, a geometric fallback astronaut will be displayed

## Tips for Optimal Results

- Ensure your model is centered at origin (0, 0, 0) in your 3D software
- Use space suit design for best thematic fit
- Include idle animations if possible
- Test your model in a GLB viewer before adding it here

## Fallback

If no model is found or there are loading errors, a geometric fallback astronaut will be displayed with helmet, suit, and basic features.
